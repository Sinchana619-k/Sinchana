A differential amplifier is a fundamental building block in analog circuit design, commonly used in applications like signal amplification, noise rejection, and operational amplifier configurations. In this experiment, we designed and analyzed a differential amplifier using LTspice based on specific design constraints, including power dissipation, supply voltage, and common-mode voltage.

The experiment involved performing DC analysis to determine the operating point, transient analysis to observe the amplifierâ€™s time-domain response, and frequency response analysis to evaluate its gain and bandwidth. The simulation results were used to extract key parameters such as differential gain, common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR), and input/output characteristics.

By utilizing LTspice, we ensured accurate modeling of circuit behavior, and the final design, along with the simulation data, is documented.
