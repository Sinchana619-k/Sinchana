# introduction

A Common-Source (CS) amplifier is a fundamental circuit used for voltage amplification in analog electronics. It is widely utilized in signal processing applications due to its high gain and moderate input impedance. In this experiment, a TSMC 180nm NMOS transistor is used to design and analyze a CS amplifier operating at VDD = 1.8V with a power budget of 50µW.

The objective of this experiment is to study the amplifier’s behavior by performing DC analysis, AC analysis, and transient analysis using LTspice. The DC analysis helps determine the operating point of the transistor, ensuring it operates in the saturation region for proper amplification. The AC analysis is conducted to evaluate the voltage gain and bandwidth, which are crucial for signal processing applications. Lastly, the transient analysis examines the amplifier’s response to time-varying input signals.

Through these analyses, key performance parameters such as gain, bandwidth, power dissipation, and operating conditions are extracted. This experiment provides insights into optimizing low-power amplifier designs for real-world applications.
